# TOTP CLI

A simple command-line tool to generate Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) using HMAC-SHA512. It follows the RFC 6238 standard and only uses Pythonâ€™s standard library.

This tool is useful for learning how 2FA systems work behind the scenes. It can generate secure codes either using an email as a base secret or a Base32-encoded key (like Google Authenticator and similar apps use).

## Features

- Generates TOTP codes that refresh every 30 seconds
- Uses HMAC-SHA512 (more secure than default SHA-1)
- Validates email or secret input
- Optional retry with clean restarts
- No external dependencies required

## How to Run

```bash
python3 main.py
